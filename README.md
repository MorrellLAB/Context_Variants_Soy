### 01_sequence_handling
This directory contains all scripts and configuration files used to process the raw FASTQ files into VCF files. Quality assessment statistics, such as mapping statistics and coverage summaries, are also included here.

### 02_snp_filtering
This directory contains all scripts used to subtract out the genetic background from the set of variants detected in the treatment lines and scripts that perform further filtering on regions of heterogeneity and runs of heterosygosity. Plotting scripts for pi across the genome are also included here.

### 03_context_analysis
This directory contains configuration files and scripts used to analyze the context of new mutations. Scripts that reproduce main figures are also located here.
